:mod:`mplcursors` provides interactive data selection cursors for Matplotlib_.
It is inspired from mpldatacursor_, with a much simplified API.

.. _Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org
.. _mpldatacursor: https://github.com/joferkington/mpldatacursor

:mod:`mplcursors` requires Matplotlib≥3.1.

.. _installation:

Installation
------------

Pick one among:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install mplcursors  # from PyPI
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors  # from Github

.. _basic-example:

Basic example
-------------

Basic examples work similarly to mpldatacursor_::

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   import mplcursors

   data = np.outer(range(10), range(1, 5))

   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   lines = ax.plot(data)
   ax.set_title("Click somewhere on a line.\nRight-click to deselect.\n"
                "Annotations can be dragged.")

   mplcursors.cursor(lines)  # or just mplcursors.cursor()

   plt.show()

.. image:: /images/basic.png

The `cursor` convenience function makes a collection of artists selectable.
Specifically, its first argument can either be a list of artists or axes (in
which case all artists in each of the axes become selectable); or one can just
pass no argument, in which case all artists in all figures become selectable.
Other arguments (which are all keyword-only) allow for basic customization of
the `Cursor`’s behavior; please refer to that class' documentation.

.. _activation-by-environment-variable:

Activation by environment variable
----------------------------------

It is possible to use :mod:`mplcursors` without modifying *any* source code:
setting the :envvar:`MPLCURSORS` environment variable to a JSON-encoded dict
will patch `Figure.draw <matplotlib.figure.Figure.draw>` to automatically
call `cursor` (with the passed keyword arguments, if any) after the figure is
drawn for the first time (more precisely, after the first draw that includes a
selectable artist). Typical settings include::

   $ MPLCURSORS={} python foo.py

and::

   $ MPLCURSORS='{"hover": 1}' python foo.py

Note that this will only work if :mod:`mplcursors` has been installed, not if
it is simply added to the :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`.

Note that this will not pick up artists added to the figure after the first
draw, e.g. through interactive callbacks.

.. _default-ui:

Default UI
----------

- A left click on a line (a point, for plots where the data points are not
  connected) creates a draggable annotation there.  Only one annotation is
  displayed (per `Cursor` instance), except if the ``multiple`` keyword
  argument was set.
- A right click on an existing annotation will remove it.
- Clicks do not trigger annotations if the zoom or pan tool are active.  It is
  possible to bypass this by *double*-clicking instead.
- For annotations pointing to lines or images, :kbd:`Shift-Left` and
  :kbd:`Shift-Right` move the cursor "left" or "right" by one data point.  For
  annotations pointing to images, :kbd:`Shift-Up` and :kbd:`Shift-Down` are
  likewise available.
- :kbd:`v` toggles the visibility of the existing annotation(s).
- :kbd:`e` toggles whether the `Cursor` is active at all (if not, no event
  other than re-activation is propagated).

These bindings are all customizable via `Cursor`’s ``bindings`` keyword
argument.  Note that the keyboard bindings are only active if the canvas has
the keyboard input focus.

.. _customization:

Customization
-------------

Instead of providing a host of keyword arguments in `Cursor`’s constructor,
:mod:`mplcursors` represents selections as `Selection` objects and lets you
hook into their addition and removal.

Specifically, a `Selection` has the following fields:

- :attr:`.artist`: the selected artist,

- :attr:`.target`: the ``(x, y)`` coordinates of the point picked within the
  artist.

- :attr:`.index`: an index of the selected point, within the artist data, as
  detailed below.

- :attr:`.dist`: the distance from the point clicked to the :attr:`.target`
  (mostly used to decide which artist to select).

- :attr:`.annotation`: a Matplotlib :class:`~matplotlib.text.Annotation`
  object.

- :attr:`.extras`: an additional list of artists, that will be removed whenever
  the main :attr:`.annotation` is deselected.

The exact meaning of :attr:`.index` depends on the selected artist:

- For :class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D`\s, the integer part of :attr:`.index`
  is the index of segment where the selection is, and its fractional part
  indicates where the selection is within that segment.

  For step plots (i.e., created by `plt.step <matplotlib.pyplot.step>` or
  `plt.plot <matplotlib.pyplot.plot>`\ ``(..., drawstyle="steps-...")``, we
  return a special :class:`Index` object, with attributes :attr:`int` (the
  segment index), :attr:`x` (how far the point has advanced in the ``x``
  direction) and :attr:`y` (how far the point has advanced in the ``y``
  direction).  See `/examples/step` for an example.

  On polar plots, lines can be either drawn with a "straight" connection
  between two points (in screen space), or "curved" (i.e., using linear
  interpolation in data space).  In the first case, the fractional part of the
  index is defined as for cartesian plots.  In the second case, the index in
  computed first on the interpolated path, then divided by the interpolation
  factor (i.e., pretending that each interpolated segment advances the same
  index by the same amount).

- For :class:`~matplotlib.image.AxesImage`\s, :attr:`.index` are the ``(y, x)``
  indices of the selected point, such that ``data[y, x]`` is the value at that
  point (note that the indices are thus in reverse order compared to the ``(x,
  y)`` target coordinates!).

- For :class:`~matplotlib.container.Container`\s, :attr:`.index` is the index
  of the selected sub-artist.

- For :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`\s and
  :class:`~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`\s, :attr:`.index` is a pair:
  the index of the selected line, and the index within the line, as defined
  above.

(Note that although `Selection` is implemented as a namedtuple, only the field
names should be considered stable API.  The number and order of fields is
subject to change with no notice.)

Thus, in order to customize, e.g., the annotation text, one can call::

   lines = ax.plot(range(3), range(3), "o")
   labels = ["a", "b", "c"]
   cursor = mplcursors.cursor(lines)
   cursor.connect(
       "add", lambda sel: sel.annotation.set_text(labels[sel.index]))

Whenever a point is selected (resp. deselected), the ``"add"`` (resp.
``"remove"``) event is triggered and the registered callbacks are executed,
with the `Selection` as only argument.  Here, the only callback updates the
text of the annotation to a per-point label. (``cursor.connect("add")`` can
also be used as a decorator to register a callback, see below for an example.)
For an example using pandas' `DataFrame <pandas.DataFrame>`\s, see
`/examples/dataframe`.

For additional examples of customization of the position and appearance of the
annotation, see `/examples/bar` and `/examples/change_popup_color`.

.. note::
   When the callback is fired, the position of the annotating text is
   temporarily set to ``(nan, nan)``.  This allows us to track whether a
   callback explicitly sets this position, and, if none does, automatically
   compute a suitable position.

   Likewise, if the text alignment is not explicitly set but the position is,
   then a suitable alignment will be automatically computed.

Callbacks can also be used to make additional changes to the figure when
a selection occurs.  For example, the following snippet (extracted from
`/examples/paired_highlight`) ensures that whenever an artist is selected,
another artist that has been "paired" with it (via the ``pairs`` map) also gets
selected::

   @cursor.connect("add")
   def on_add(sel):
       sel.extras.append(cursor.add_highlight(pairs[sel.artist]))

Note that the paired artist will also get de-highlighted when the "first"
artist is deselected.

In order to set the status bar text from a callback, it may be helpful to
clear it during "normal" mouse motion, e.g.::

   fig.canvas.mpl_connect(
       "motion_notify_event",
       lambda event: fig.canvas.toolbar.set_message(""))
   cursor = mplcursors.cursor(hover=True)
   cursor.connect(
       "add",
       lambda sel: fig.canvas.toolbar.set_message(
           sel.annotation.get_text().replace("\n", "; ")))

.. _complex-plots:

Complex plots
-------------

Some complex plots, such as contour plots, may be partially supported,
or not at all.  Typically, it is because they do not subclass
:class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist`, and thus appear to `cursor` as a collection
of independent artists (each contour level, in the case of contour plots).

It is usually possible, again, to hook the ``"add"`` signal to provide
additional information in the annotation text.  See `/examples/contour` for an
example.

Animations
----------

Matplotlib's :mod:`.animation` blitting mode assumes that the animation
object is entirely in charge of deciding what artists to draw and when.  In
particular, this means that the ``animated`` property is set on certain
artists.  As a result, when :mod:`mplcursors` tries to blit an animation on
top of the image, the animated artists will not be drawn, and disappear.  More
importantly, it also means that once an annotation is added, :mod:`mplcursors`
cannot remove it (as it needs to know what artists to redraw to restore the
original state).

As a workaround, either switch off blitting, or unset the ``animated``
property on the relevant artists before using a cursor.  (The only other
fix I can envision is to walk the entire tree of artists, record their
visibility status, and try to later restore them; but this would fail for
:class:`~matplotlib.animation.ArtistAnimation`\s which themselves fiddle with
artist visibility).
